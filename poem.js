    "The emotion is to be found in the clouds,",
    "not in the green solids of the sloping hills",
    "or even in the gray signatures of rivers,",
    "according to Constable, who was a student of clouds",
    "and filled shelves of sketchbooks with their motion,",
    "their lofty gesturing and sudden implication of weather.",

    "Outdoors, he must have looked up thousands of times,",
    "his pencil trying to keep pace with their high voyaging",
    "and the silent commotion of their eddying and flow.",
    "Clouds would move beyond the outlines he would draw",
    "as they moved within themselves, tumbling into their centers",
    "and swirling off at the burning edges in vapors",
    "to dissipate into the universal blue of the sky.",

    "In photographs we can stop all this movement now",
    "long enough to tag them with their Latin names.",
    "Cirrus, nimbus, stratocumulus —",
    "dizzying, romantic, authoritarian —",
    "they bear their titles over the schoolhouses below",
    "where their shapes and meanings are memorized.",

    "High on the soft blue canvases of Constable",
    "they are stuck in pigment but his clouds appear",
    "to be moving still in the wind of his brush,",
    "inching out of England and the nineteenth century",
    "and sailing over these meadows where I am walking,",
    "bareheaded beneath this cupola of motion,",
    "my thoughts arranged like paint on a high blue ceiling."
